# Virtual-Aquarium

## Abstract
**An aquarium is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fish-keepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term "aquarium", coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning "a place for relating to".

**In aquarium we put small small colourful stones. These looks extremely beautiful when light falls upon these.

**We also keep aquatic plant in aquarium.

**In this project we are trying to implement the real view of aquarium by using Computer graphics. This project gives an opportunity and real feeling of aquarium that we can actually view. We use JavaScript to implement the concept and build the virtual Aquarium. This project made us realize what is the actual use of computer graphics in real life and why it is important.
